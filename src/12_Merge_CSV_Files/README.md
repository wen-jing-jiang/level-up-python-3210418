# Python Code Challenge #12: Merge CSV Files

Your goal is to implement a function, `merge_csv()`, that takes two input arguments: a list of file paths to CSV files to merge and an output file path to save the resulting CSV file.

## Example Test Output
Using the two included CSV files with student grades as input:

```console
>>> merge_csv(['class1.csv', 'class2.csv'], 'all_students.csv')
```
