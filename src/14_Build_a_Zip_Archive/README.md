# Python Code Challenge #14: Build a ZIP Archive

Your goal is to implement a function, `zip_all()`, that takes three input arguments for a path to the top-level directory you want to include, a list of file extensions, and an output file path for the resulting archive.

## Example Test Output
Using the included directory of images and text files as input:

```console
>>> zip_all('my_stuff', ['.jpg', '.txt'], 'my_stuff.zip')
```
