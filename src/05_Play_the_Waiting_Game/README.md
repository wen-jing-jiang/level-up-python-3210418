# Python Code Challenge #5: Play the Waiting Game

Your goal is to implement a function, `waiting_game()`, that prints a message for the player to wait a random amount of time, somewhere between two to four seconds. When the player presses Enter, that starts a timer. The player's goal is to wait the specified number of seconds and then press Enter again. That displays the elapsed time, along with a message about whether the player was too fast, too slow, or right on target. 

## Example Test Output
```console
>>> waiting_game()

Your target time is 2 seconds
 ---Press Enter to Begin---

...Press Enter again after 2 seconds...

Elapsed time: 1.680 seconds
(0.320 seconds too fast)
```
