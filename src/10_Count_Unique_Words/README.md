# Python Code Challenge #10: Count Unique Words

Your goal is to implement a function, `count_words()`, that takes the path to a text file as the input argument and prints the total number of words in the file, as well as the top 20 most frequently used words and how many times each of them occurs.

## Example Test Output
Using [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt) as input:

```console
>>> count_words('shakespeare.txt')


Total Words: 976836

Top 20 Words:
