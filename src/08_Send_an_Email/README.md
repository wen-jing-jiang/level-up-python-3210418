# Python Code Challenge #8: Send an Email

Your goal is to implement a function, `send_email()`, that takes three input arguments for the recipient’s email address, the email’s subject line, and the email message body.

## Example Test Output
```console
>>> send_email('recipient@email.com', ‘Notification', 'Everything is awesome!')
```

The recipient should receive an email with the subject "Notification" and the message body "Everything is aweseome!"
