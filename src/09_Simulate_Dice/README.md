# Python Code Challenge #9: Simulate Dice

Your goal is to implement a function, `roll_dice()`, that takes a variable number of input arguments representing the number of sides on an arbitrary number of dice, its and its output should print a table of the probability for each possible outcome.

## Example Test Output
Rolling one four-sided die and two six-sided dices:
```console
>>> roll_dice(4,6,6)

OUTCOME PROBABILITY
3       0.69%
4       2.06%
5       4.14%
6       6.95%
7       9.70%
8       12.55%
9       13.93%
10      13.85%
11      12.52%
12      9.70%
13      6.95%
14      4.17%
15      2.09%
16      0.70%
```
