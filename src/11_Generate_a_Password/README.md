# Python Code Challenge #11: Generate a Password

Your goal is to implement a function, `generate_passphrase()`, that takes the number of words to include in the password as the input argument and returns a string containing a sequence of randomly selected words from the [Diceware list](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc) separated by spaces.

```console
>>> generate_passphrase(4)
'correct horse battery staple'
```
