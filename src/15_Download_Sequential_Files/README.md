# Python Code Challenge #15: Download Sequential Files

Your goal is to implement a function, `download_files()`, that takes two input arguments: the URL for the first item in the sequence, and a path to the output directory where you want to save them. 

## Example Test Output
Using the example URL hosting 50 images, with the first image at http://699340.youcanlearnit.net/image001.jpg:

```console
>>> download_files('http://699340.youcanlearnit.net/image001.jpg', './images')
```
